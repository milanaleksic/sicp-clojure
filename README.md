# SICP, Clojure form

This app is just a trivial Leiningen / Clojure reimplementation of some aspects of the SICP book, freely available at [SICP in Clojure](http://sicpinclojure.com/).

## Running

- install Leiningen
- execute `lein repl`
- compile and run main functions as desired
 
For example: 

    (compile 'chapter1.c116)
    (chapter1.c116/-main)
